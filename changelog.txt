- Fix certain minor errors not being retried
- Improve performance while installing large mods
- Fix install prompt only showing one per-mod update setting
- Add per-mod update settings to Penumbra window
- Change update process to be faster for larger mods
- Use less disk space for updates on filesystems without hard link support
- Add option to collapse Heliosphere settings in Penumbra by default
- Make Heliosphere settings collapsible on a per-mod basis in Penumbra

Note that updates for larger mods are still fairly slow, but a redundant step is
